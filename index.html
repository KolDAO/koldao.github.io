				<h2>Why ShillDAO?</h2>
				<p>Select via DAO the projects that have real values, potentials, and those were underestimated. Get
					more people involved in the project growth via holding their tokens and promoting them voluntarily
					among and outside ShillDAO members.</p>
				<h2>How it works?</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Potential Project </li>
					<li>Project team/Token holders initiate Shill Proposal </li>
					<li>Submit Shill Proposal</li>
					<li>ShillDAO members vote whether to shill this project </li>
					<li>Proposal passed </li>
					<li>ShillDAO members hold project token and benefit from further shilling </li>
				</ol>
				<h2>DAO</h2>
				<p>ShillDAO is managed by a Telegram group and an Aragon governance tool.</p>
				<h3>Telegram group (DAO)</h3>
				<p>ShillDAO discussions and information sync will be done in Telegram group</p>
				<p><b>Access threshold :</b> Hold 2333 SHILL at least</p>
				<p><b>Ragequit :</b> ShillDAO uses the Collab.land robot to automatically read the number of SHILL held
					by associate members. When the number of SHILL they hold is equal to or higher than the access
					threshold, the Collab.land robot will send an invite link to them to join the Telegram group. If the
					number is lower than the access threshold, the Collab.land robot will automatically remove them from
					the group and cancel their membership.</p>
				<p>Members in ShillDAO telegram group : up to 233, with 543,589 SHILL in total</p>
				<p>ShillDAO keeps the rights to remove the members, SHILL tokens will be returned the same ration of
					1:233</p>
				<h3>DAO governance tool</h3>
				<p>ShillDAO governance will be done using Aragon DAO tools, including voting for proposals, DAO issues,
					etc.</p>
				<p>Access mechanism : Anyone holding ShillDAO governance token (SHILL) will have an opportunity to
					participate in the governance.</p>
				<p>ShillDAO link: </p>
				<p><a href="https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/shilldao/"
						target="_blank">https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/shilldao/</a></p>
				<hr>
				<h3>SHILL</h3>
				<p>SHILL is the governance token of ShillDAO. With SHILL, you will have : </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Rigths of governance, eg: making decision and voting, etc.</li>
					<li>Rights of submitting proposal. Anyone who pays 23.3 SHILL or more can initiate proposals, more
						details please check the "How to submit proposals" below.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Total amount: 2,333,333 SHILL</p>
				<p>Initial purchase price:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>10 ETH = 2,333 SHILL</li>
					<li>100 ETH = 23,333 SHILL</li>
				</ul>
				<hr>
				<h3>DAO Initial Configuration</h3>
				<p>Founding members limit: < 100 ppl</p>
				<p>Access threshold: stake 10 ETH or 100 ETH</p>
				<p>Creatation of liquility: 75% of the initial financing will be used to create SHILL liquidity
							on Uniswap and the liquidity will be permanently locked. The remaining 25% will be used as
							DAO reserve funds, which will be used to pay for website/smart contract development and
							related marketing expenses in the future.</p>
				<h3>How to participate afterwards?</h3>
				<p>After this phase, people can only buy SHILL on Uniswap or buy via Aragon Token Request with a higher price to participate in ShillDAO and provide their background information for membership reviews. DAO members will vote for/against his/her participation.</p>
				<h3>How to submit the proposal?</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Describe in detail about your proposal on Github, submit to Telegram group for the first review.</li>
					<li>Initiate and submit a proposal on Aragon, pay 23.3 SHILL (If submit a same proposal later, you need to pay double)(If the proposer want to provide token rewards, it should be described in Github issue, and transfer the token to ShillDAO before submitting the proposal.</li>
					<li>DAO member vote for the proposal</li>
					<li>If the proposal passed, the proposer will receive 233 SHILL as rewards, then DAO member start to shill this project! ( After the proposal submitted, each voter will receive 2.33 SHILL as rewards if the target price rise above 30%)</li>
				</ol>
				<p><b>Please keep this mind:</b></p>
				<p><b>The key incentives for DAO members mainly come from his/her amount of holdings of the project tokens, not rewards!</b></p>
